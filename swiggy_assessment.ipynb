        "\r\n",
        "Before getting into the aspect of handling demand in a better way, it is useful to understand what drives demand during the peak hours. \r\n",
        "Peak demand on food delivery services occurs during peak dinner time which ranges between 8 – 10 PM and tapers beyond that, as for days of the week there is significant increase seen during weekends and a seasonality observed during occasions and festive holidays.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Increasing the fleet size to meet demand and reducing available restaurants to customers in their search radius does help with handling the problem but that increases expenses and reduces customer experience, hence it’s not the best way to handle peak demand hours.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "**B** – Availability of its hyperlocal delivery fleet to service any given order\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1.\tDemand on the customer side can only be offset by optimizing parameters controlled by Swiggy in agent assignment and grouping orders by clustering them by delivery time.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2.\tPeak demand hours can be met by incentivizing the delivery fleet to operate actively during the peak hours, this will create a large pool of agents to which orders can be assigned.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3.\tDynamic pricing on delivery cost can help handle excessive demand on occasions and festive days when the fleet will not be capable to handle the surplus demand, this is meant to moderate the demand side and not to alienate customers with high cost.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4.\tBalancing the availability of delivery agents in areas that have shown to have maximum demand using historical data.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5.\tDemand is seen to shift in areas and is not uniform within a city, this can be used to push agents within the search radius to ensure that all delivery agents are continuously carrying out orders and no time is lost being idle.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "6.\tRestaurants that are overrun with orders and in-house dining should be able to limit the intake orders to ensure all deliveries are within the allotted time.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "7.\tDelivery agents can be intimated about the influx of orders that happen during peak hours in certain parts of the city so that less time is spent idle.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "8.\tOrders that are along the same delivery path of the agent should be grouped together as long it falls within the total delivery time hence it increases the total available agents in a given area to meet the demand.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "9.\tSince the time it takes for the restaurant in food preparation and the first mile time occurs in a parallel manner theses estimates can be kept to be as close to each other as possible thereby reducing the idle time from the delivery agent and the restaurant which in turn also improves overall availability of delivery agents.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "10.\tThere should be load balancing in the assignment of agents in a manner which doesn’t create a drop of agents in a particular region at any given time this might cause the delivery times to go up.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "We have 1000 number of queries from orders and increasing to 5000 within the outage duration, in an hour a single agent handles 12 customers, so going by that number we at least need a bare minimum of 85 agents who can resolve the growing order queries provided the 1000 odd incoming chats are within the stipulated hour. The issue chat threads that are created are also dependent on the level of priority given by swiggy depending on the nature of the issue related to the order.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1.\tThe first line of queries are handled by chatbots and the nature of customer issue gets broken down, by identifying and prioritizing the orders that have order fulfilment related issues we can improve delivery rate.\r\n",
        "2.\tThe first step to ensure if the order fulfillment can be met for those 1000 priority orders by cross checking with the restaurant or the delivery agent.\r\n",
        "3.\tSince the trackers are offline, the call center personnel can utilize direct means of communication with the agent, restaurant and customer to resolve order issues.\r\n",
        "4.\tThe delivery agent may confirm the order fulfilment to the customer from their end and from the restaurant.\r\n",
        "5.\tHistorically there should be a pattern where order fulfillment has seen periodic failure, either from the delivery agent or the restaurant, concentrating in resolving these orders can help reduce the instances where customer experience gets affected\r\n",
        "6.\twith internal customer segments, we can prioritize those customers who are likely to use our services more and ensure that fulfillment is maximized on these customer segments, (swiggy super).\r\n",
